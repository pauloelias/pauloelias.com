After going through one hell of a ride in 2019 I am finally happy to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I will save the details about my journey through a very hard Q4 for its own post but I am just happy to have an amazing family, awesome friends, and great health.

Now that "Quareter of Hell" is behind I am back on track to regular posts. I have so much I want to learn and teach this year that I am excited to have an outlet to share my journey. Keep an eye on this space as I get back into rolling out regular [Work Log updates](/journal).

Onwards and upwards!
