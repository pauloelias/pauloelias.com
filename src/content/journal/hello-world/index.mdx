This weekend I shipped a new feature for my blog--search! Just have a look up and to the right. You should see it up there.

Adding search was easier than I expected. I had almost no understanding of the work involved in making this happen, but between the Algolia service, their `react-instantsearch` library, and a little help from Twitter, this was pretty simple to do. This post will walk you through all the steps it took to make that happen.
