After a brief hiatus due to [horrendous Q4](/journal/welcome-to-2020) this worklog is almost back on track!

Over the next few weeks I'll be slowly getting back into documenting what I have done, what I will be doing, and what I want to do in the future.

**What I've done this week:**

- Regroup and recharge for 2020

**To do next week:**

I still have a backlog of items I want to fix on this site and will be posting them as I get back into the swing of things.
