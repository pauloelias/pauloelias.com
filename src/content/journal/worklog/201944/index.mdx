This will be a super quick update since I am in the middle of my site build.

After launching my [Tailwind + Emotion Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/pauloelias/gatsby-tailwind-emotion-starter), and updating the readme to add some clearer examples, I got cracking on planning out my own site and even had a chace to start building.

**What I've done this week:**

- Gathered sample sites I like
- Collected a handful of other open-source Gatsby sites on Github to learn some tips and tricks
- Planned out the [IA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and content
- Gathered links and placeholder content
- Set up the Github repo
- Planned out the entire [Github Project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)
- Started building out the skeleton

**To do next week:**

- Install and configiure npm packages and gatsby plugins
- Write content
- Write sample queries to pull the content I need
- Wire up a skeleton to pull content where I need it
- Build out the site components
- Properly style the site
- Set up hosting
- Make sure it's [ready to launch](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-eight/)
- Profit? ðŸ’°
