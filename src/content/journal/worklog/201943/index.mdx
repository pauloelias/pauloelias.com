As I was gearing up to finally re-launch a proper personal website I did what most developers do... Tinker. Why be productive when you can just keep learning new things? ðŸ˜¬

Way back in the day this site used to run on WordPress. Then, as I moved to ExpressionEngine I think I built three different iterations of the site that I never launched. Every year as the [May 1st Reboot](https://www.may1reboot.com/) approached I would start planning out my new site to finally get it launched. I worked on the site sporadically using my local development version as a testbed for things I was learning at the time. I must have built it 10+ different times using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com), [Nest](https://nestjs.com), [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Statamic](https://statamic.com), and multiple versions of [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com).

Learning is great and all but at some point you have to ship.

Of course, as I was getting back into the cycle of preparing to build out my site, I started tinkering with an idea I was working on at the day job. [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com) loves to prototype. I love to prototype. Why not make it easier to prototype website and web app ideas?

Our team was already using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for our production site so I wanted to take my experience with it to see how we can leverage it for smaller projects and prototypes. As I kept thinking about it I kept coming back to the idea of spinning up a simple Gatsby project with a minimal starter theme that leveraged the CSS-in-JS library [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) and the utility-first CSS framework, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

After about a week of figuring out how to wire everything up (in my spare time) I finally launched my [Tailwind + Emotion Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/pauloelias/gatsby-tailwind-emotion-starter). Unbeknownst to me [Andrew Welch](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-tailwind-css-with-gatsby-react-emotion-styled-components) had a similar idea at the same time. Great minds, right?

This was a perfect project to take on before I buckled down and built out my site. Building the starter was limited in scope, it gave me a series of small wins that allowed me to keep my momentum, and I was able to learn a few Gatsby tricks that would have stalled my website build. Plus I got a free t-shirt out of it for adding it to the [Official Gatsby Starter Showcase](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/pauloelias/gatsby-tailwind-emotion-starter/)!

Got check out the [Tailwind + Emotion Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/pauloelias/gatsby-tailwind-emotion-starter), give it whirl, and let me know what you think.
